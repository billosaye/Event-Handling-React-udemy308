# Event Listening in React

This repository contains a simple React application that demonstrates how to implement event listeners for handling user interactions, such as clicks and mouse events.

## Features

- **Dynamic Heading Update**: The heading text updates based on user actions, changing from "Hello" to "Submitted" when the submit button is clicked.
- **Mouse Event Handling**: The background color of the submit button changes when the user hovers over or out of the button.
- **Text Input**: A text input field allows users to type their name.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-event-listening.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd react-event-listening
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## File Structure

- **App.js**: Contains the core logic for setting up event listeners and handling user interactions, including click and mouse events.
- **index.js**: Renders the `App` component and attaches it to the DOM.
- **styles.css**: Provides basic styling for the application.

## Event Listeners Implemented

1. **handleClick**: Updates the heading text when the submit button is clicked.
2. **handleMouseOver**: Changes the button's background color to black when the mouse hovers over it.
3. **handleMouseOut**: Reverts the button's background color to white when the mouse moves out.

## Usage

1. **Enter your name** in the text input field.
2. **Hover over the submit button** to see the background color change.
3. **Click the submit button** to observe the heading text update.
